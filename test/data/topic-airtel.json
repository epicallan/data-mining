I have also heard that there will only be 500 invited guests. This therefore means that it is an invite only event. I am not too sure what the criteria for getting invited is but if I don't get invited for his party, I swear I am throwing a tantrum. I will roll on the floor, yell obscenities and shout in my mother tongue. Luckily this will be after the Pope is gone so we shall be back to our sinful ways. I am just putting it out there that I want to attend this party. May the Universe listen and act accordingly ‪#‎ThatWillBeAll‬",

    "post": "Hi guys! You can call me malcolm. I was working for a major telecomms service provider company in Uganda rendering services to telecom companies like Airtel UG, MTN, Huawei, and Ericsson. These services included commissioning and decommissioning of telecommunication equipment on sites (mulongoti) all over the country; including packaging and transportation of the said telecom equipment. I was handling the IT section. I left the company after it delayed paying employees' salar...ies due to delays like invoicing, acceptance...and the rest. The thing is, I then hijacked their most valued source of information/data until they paid me. Which they did but they paid me less (1.2m) and failed to clear till now. I then re-hijacked it again until they got fed up! So they opened a new business email. Now this valuable source of info (biz email) was where they communicated with Ericsson, Airtel....and the rest and it includes all their business communications, contacts, contracts & agreements including the general workflow of the business. Thing is, I hav no use for it anymore and anyone here who may see use in this data may inbox me such that I find a way to dispose of it. It may be very much useful for those doing mass communication/telecommunication engineering coz we all know how complicated that stuff is; but this data makes it easy to understand. Be it site links, making quotations, pricebooks, invoices...how to deal with URA, contacts of all ASPs....EVERYTHING! ",

    "post": "‪#‎PopeInUganda‬ Full Text of Pope Francis' Address to the Youth at Kololo Airstrip All of you, be aware, be aware that you are a people of martyrs. Through your own veins runs the blood of martyrs, and that's why you have such a strong faith and life that you enjoy now. In order to live, we have to die...but, through that death, there is light for all. A wall can be transformed into a path towards the future. There's always the possibility of opening a door, a horizon to the... future, and to open it through the Power of Jesus. Winnie transformed her depression and bad experiences into hope. This isn't magic. This is the work of Jesus Christ, because Jesus is Lord. Jesus can do everything. Jesus had experienced the greatest sufferings in history, having been “insulted, rejected, and murdered,” but was Risen from the dead. He can do the same in us with every single thing that we experience, because Jesus is Lord. A light is like a seed. In order to live, we have to die. And dying sometimes like Emmanuel's friends – Dying as Charles Lwanga died, and the martyrs – but, through that death there is light for all. If I can transform the negative into positive, I am triumphant in the Lord. But, that can only be done with the grace of Jesus Christ. Are you ready in life to transform all your negative experiences into positive ones? Are you ready to transform hate into love? Are you ready to transform war into peace? When we're not working properly (like the microphone), who do we have to turn to for help? Jesus! He can tear down all the walls that lie before you. When we have a problem, the first thing we can do is go to our mother. Pray to Mary, our mother. Pray to the Lord Jesus, because he is the only Lord. In the Church, we are not orphans, because we have Mary our mother. Picture Credit & Copy Credit: CNA ",

She still holds the PAM award record of having won the Artist of the year award for two consecutive years 2008 and 2009. The multi-talented Juliana has also hosted a morning radio program on Capital FM and even made a film debut in Henry Ssali...'s Kiwani: The Movie. She’s a great inspiration to many women in Uganda today. Today we’re celebrating Ugandans that have made the Pearl of Africa a proud Nation. Hashtag #MyAirtelMyCountry to celebrate with us.

Some of our friends were murdered… I was tortured and they tied my hands behind my back and I failed to breathe. I wanted to ask to be killed than to suffer such a pain.
